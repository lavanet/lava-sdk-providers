<b>Access Web3 APIs, the Lava way ðŸŒ‹</b>

This repository contains implementations of providers for various third-party libraries used for accessing blockchains.

The providers in this repository use the [Lava-SDK](https://github.com/lavanet/lava-sdk) for decentralized access using the Lava ecosystem. The lava-sdk provides an easy-to-use interface for querying specified network in fully decentralized way, and the providers in this repository abstract away the implementation details for specific third-party libraries.
